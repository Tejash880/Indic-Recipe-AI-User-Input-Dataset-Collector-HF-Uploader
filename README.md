By providing a structured yet simple interface, Indic Recipe AI bridges the gap between culinary knowledge, regional cultural practices, and artificial intelligence research.

The motivation behind Indic Recipe AI is grounded in addressing the lack of high-quality datasets for Indic languages, particularly in the culinary domain. While AI technologies and large language models have grown exponentially, the datasets for Indian languages remain sparse, fragmented, and inconsistent. Many existing datasets either cover very few languages or only focus on English translations of Indian content, which limits the AI's ability to understand cultural nuances and linguistic diversity. Indic Recipe AI seeks to solve this problem by enabling users to directly contribute content in their native languages, ensuring authenticity and richness in the collected data.

One of the core issues in dataset collection for Indic languages is the lack of standardization. Recipes in different regions are recorded differently, with variations in units, ingredient names, and steps. Without a structured approach, training AI models becomes challenging, and the resulting models often perform poorly in real-world applications. Indic Recipe AI addresses these challenges by enforcing a structured input system, ensuring that all entries follow a consistent format.

The platform‚Äôs key strength lies in its ability to combine text, images, and optional audio for each recipe. Users can input the recipe name, list of ingredients, detailed instructions, the language of the recipe, and upload an image of the prepared dish. This approach creates a rich dataset suitable for advanced AI applications, including multi-modal training, image recognition, and text-to-recipe AI assistants. Additionally, the system allows for easy conversion of the collected data into JSONL format, which is the preferred input for fine-tuning language models. Each line in the JSONL file represents a single recipe entry with all associated fields, making it machine-readable and ready for AI pipelines.

To ensure wide usability and security, Indic Recipe AI integrates with Hugging Face, a platform widely used for sharing and managing AI datasets. Users can input their Hugging Face token directly into the interface to securely upload their datasets. This integration allows for collaborative dataset building, sharing, and versioning. The token is handled securely and never stored permanently, ensuring the privacy of user credentials while allowing seamless dataset upload and management. This functionality encourages collaborative contribution, where multiple users can continuously add to the dataset, creating a comprehensive repository of recipes from different Indic languages and cuisines.

The technology stack for Indic Recipe AI is carefully chosen to balance simplicity, accessibility, and future scalability. Python serves as the core programming language, providing both backend processing and scripting capabilities. Streamlit is employed for the web interface, enabling real-time interaction with minimal setup. The Pandas library manages data manipulation, ensuring efficient handling of structured datasets in CSV and JSONL formats. For users interested in audio capabilities, pyttsx3 can be integrated to generate audio narration of recipes, creating a multi-modal dataset that can serve as training data for AI models capable of speech synthesis or audio-guided cooking assistance.

Installation and setup of the platform are designed to be straightforward. Users only need a Python environment and access to the required libraries. The Streamlit interface launches in a browser, allowing users to input recipe data intuitively. Each recipe can be saved locally in CSV format, preserving all essential details. Over time, this local dataset can be exported to JSONL format, providing a ready-to-use dataset for AI training. The process is designed to be user-centric, requiring no prior programming knowledge, making it accessible to students, interns, and AI enthusiasts alike.

Indic Recipe AI also emphasizes data integrity and structure. Ingredients and instructions are recorded in a consistent manner to prevent ambiguities. Optional images provide visual context, which is crucial for multi-modal AI applications. By collecting high-quality, human-verified data, the platform ensures that AI models trained on these datasets can generate accurate and culturally relevant responses. Each entry is timestamped, creating a record of dataset growth over time and enabling dataset versioning if needed.

One of the most significant features of Indic Recipe AI is its ability to support multiple Indic languages. The platform includes pre-configured language options, allowing users to select the language in which they are submitting their recipe. This ensures that the dataset maintains linguistic diversity, which is essential for training AI models capable of understanding regional nuances. Over time, as more users contribute, the dataset becomes increasingly comprehensive, representing a wide variety of Indian cuisines and language styles.

The platform also supports Hugging Face integration to facilitate dataset sharing and collaboration. Users can upload their collected datasets to Hugging Face repositories using their personal tokens.

By leveraging Hugging Face‚Äôs ecosystem, Indic Recipe AI enables collaborative building of high-quality datasets, promoting open science and community-driven AI research. The integration also supports version control, ensuring that contributors can track changes, updates, and improvements to the dataset over time.

Security is a core consideration in Indic Recipe AI. The Hugging Face token is entered directly by the user in a password field and is only used temporarily for authentication during dataset upload. The token is never stored on disk, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access. Additionally, the platform‚Äôs user interface encourages responsible dataset management, allowing contributors to review their entries before uploading and ensuring that only verified and accurate recipes are added to the shared dataset.

Indic Recipe AI offers numerous practical use cases. Researchers can use it to create large, high-quality datasets for fine-tuning AI models.
